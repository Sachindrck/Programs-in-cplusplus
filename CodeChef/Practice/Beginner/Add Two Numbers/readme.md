## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program. 
Program is very simple, given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers.

## Input

The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains two Integers A and B.

## Output

For each test case, add A and B and display it in a new line.

Take special care for the output format; everything your program prints is considered “output”, so if you output some debugging statements like 
“Please enter T” or print something like: “The answer is: ”, this will be considered as part of your answer, and because it does not satisfy the 
output format, it will be marked wrong, even if your answer is otherwise correct!

## Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

0 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000

## Example

## Input
3 

1   2

100   200

10  40

## Output
