// Program to find GCD of two numbers!

// A simple solution is to find all prime factors of both numbers, then find intersection of all 
// factors present in both numbers. Finally return product of elements in the intersection.

// An efficient solution is to use Euclidean algorithm which is the main algorithm used for this purpose. 
// The idea is, GCD of two numbers doesnâ€™t change if smaller number is subtracted from a bigger number.
